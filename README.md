# ReactFirstProject
<h3>Hey dears,</h3>
<p>This is my first reactjs project that consists 3*divs and 6*spans.</p>
<p>
  In this case we're using react by CDN which is taken from the</br>
  reactjs official website <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html">(This Link)</a>
</p>
<p>
  I animate the div tags by using animation property at the css file.</br>
  The animations have the ability to show everything alive and</br>
  you can add it more creative features by your own styles...
</p>
</br></br>
<strong>GOOD LUCK</strong>
